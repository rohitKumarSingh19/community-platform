# Community Collaboration Platform Backend

## Overview
This is the backend for the **Community Collaboration Platform**. It is built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB** to provide an API for managing users, posts, projects, and discussions.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing data.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Used for authentication and authorization.
- **bcryptjs**: For password hashing.
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or above)
- MongoDB running locally or on a cloud service.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the backend directory:

bash
Copy
cd community-platform/backend
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
npm install
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your environment variables:

env
Copy
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/communityDB
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
BCRYPT_SALT=10
Run the backend server:

bash
Copy
npm run dev
The server should now be running at http://localhost:5000.

API Endpoints
Authentication
POST /api/auth/login - Login a user.
POST /api/auth/register - Register a new user.
Posts
POST /api/posts/create - Create a new post. (Requires JWT)
GET /api/posts - Get all posts.
Projects
POST /api/projects/create - Create a new project. (Requires JWT)
GET /api/projects - Get all projects.
Middleware
authMiddleware.js: Protect routes that require authentication with JWT.
Notes
Make sure MongoDB is running and connected.
Use Postman or any other API testing tool to test the API endpoints.

# Community Collaboration Platform Client

## Overview
This is the client for the **Community Collaboration Platform**. It is a React-based application that connects to the backend API for handling user authentication, post creation, project collaboration, and discussion.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For handling route navigation.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests.
- **React Toastify**: For showing notifications.
- **React Context API**: For managing global state.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or above)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the client directory:

bash
Copy
cd community-platform/client
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
npm install
Run the client development server:

bash
Copy
npm start
The app should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

File Structure
src/components/: Reusable components such as Navbar, PostCard, etc.
src/pages/: Pages for each route, including Home, Login, Register, etc.
src/context/: Global context for authentication state.
src/assets/: Static assets like images and logos.
Routes
Home (/): The landing page with a "Get Started" button.
Login (/login): User login page.
Register (/register): User registration page.
Share Ideas (/share-ideas): Page for sharing ideas and posting them.
Collaborate (/collaborate): Page for collaboration and working on projects together.
Learn & Grow (/learn-grow): Page for enhancing skills through discussions.
Notes
This client connects to the backend API running at http://localhost:5000.
Make sure the backend server is running before starting the client.
Additional Setup (Optional)
You can deploy this app using services like Heroku, Netlify, or Vercel for the frontend and services like MongoDB Atlas for the database.
Instructions for Testing and Debugging:
Backend Testing:

Test the API using Postman or any API testing tool.
Check for the correct JWT token handling for user login and post creation.
Frontend Testing:

Test the login, registration, and post-creation functionality.
Check if data is fetched and displayed correctly (like posts and projects).
Ensure that the frontend is properly connected to the backend API and that the routes are functional.
How to Use
Start the backend server (Node.js).
Start the frontend server (React).
Visit http://localhost:3000 to interact with the platform.
This setup should give you a full-fledged collaboration platform where users can register, login, post ideas, collaborate on projects, and discuss skills for learning and growing.
